##Summary
With a strong background as a chef and kitchen lead, I have honed my skills in coordination, communication, and process management. My experience includes overseeing food preparation and ensuring efficient operations by implementing structured systems and promoting teamwork under pressure.

I have recently transitioned into Business Intelligence (BI) Analytics, applying my passion for data and results-driven mindset to transform data into actionable insights. Over the past year, I have focused on BI tools, data analysis, and visualization (using Tableau) to build a strong analytical foundation. My combined experience in leadership and analytics enables me to drive smarter, insight-based business decisions.
